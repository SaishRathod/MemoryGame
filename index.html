        <h2>Rules of the game:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The player first turns over 2 cards.</li>
          <li>
            If the logos match, the player keeps the cards and tries again for
            another match.
          </li>
          <li>If they do not match the cards are turned over again.</li>
          <li>
            The player must try to remember where they have seen the cards, so
            they can use them to make a match.
          </li>
          <li>The round ends when all of the cards have been matched.</li>
          <li>
            Your scores will be calculated on the basis of time taken to
            complete the rounds.
